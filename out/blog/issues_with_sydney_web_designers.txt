13:T10c9,<p>Hey.</p>
<p>A few weeks ago I was reading a book: '$1,000,000 Web Designer'. Just checking out the competition.</p>
<p>To cut a long story short, it showed me that 90%+ of web designers focus on one thing: <em>web design</em>.</p>
<p>Now I've been studying web design for months. Reading everything. Analyzing hundreds of websites.</p>
<p>Before reading that book, I didn't even think that web design in itself was the issue.</p>
<p>But I was wrong.</p>
<h2>The $10,000 Digital Business Card Problem</h2>
<p>Here's what's happening in Sydney, and other major cities around the world: every web design agency is selling the same thing.</p>
<p>Pretty websites that don't do much.</p>
<p>They feed you words like "elevated digital presence" and sell you on a $10,000 website that just sites there and looks pretty.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, their potential customers are on Google right now, looking to find someone who can solve their problem. Looking for someone who simply says: "Blocked drain? Fixed today. Call now."</p>
<h2>So I Started Digging Deeper</h2>
<p>Plumbers. Dentists. Accountants. Lawyers.</p>
<p>Know What I found?</p>
<p>90% of them say the same thing. It's the top performers that are different.</p>
<ul>
<li>"Sydney's trusted partner"</li>
<li>"Excellence in everything we do"</li>
<li>"Transforming your digital landscape"</li>
</ul>
<p>Here's the kicker: Their customers don't care about that stuff! That's only for you, as the business owner.</p>
<h2>What Do Customers Want?</h2>
<p>What actually makes a phone ring?</p>
<p>After analyzing hundreds of top performers across many niches, I can tell you what's working.</p>
<p>The guy that get's calls? His website says: 'Blocked drain? Fixed within 2 hours. $0 call out fee."
The dentist who's booked? "Emergency appointments available today. No referral neeeded"</p>
<p>Do you notice what's missing?</p>
<p>There's no philosophy! No mission statements, nothing the customer won't benefit from.</p>
<p>It's just clear answers to what people really search for.</p>
<h2>The Designer Disease</h2>
<p>Here's what most Sydney web designers do:</p>
<ol>
<li>Show you pretty templates</li>
<li>Talk about 'user experience journeys'</li>
<li>Add moving &#x26; animated elements (that make it look cool)</li>
<li>Fill it with basic stock photos</li>
<li>Write copy that sounds impressive, but doesn't really mean much</li>
<li>Charge you $10,000</li>
<li>Never talk to you again</li>
</ol>
<p>You end up with a website, yes, but what does it actually achieve for you?</p>
<h2>It Has One Simple Job</h2>
<p>Your website should have one job: Make your phone ring.</p>
<p>It doesn't need to impress your clients, nor win awards. It's all about the customers it closes.</p>
<p>After months of studying this, here's what separates top competitors from the crowd:</p>
<ol>
<li>Headlines that highlight the immediate benefit: "Need an emergency electrician in Parramatta? Call now."</li>
<li>Proof that sells: "Average response time of 30 minutes"</li>
<li>One clear action: "Call now - [number]"</li>
</ol>
<p>It's really that simple, yet it's so hard to find.</p>
<h2>The Opportunity</h2>
<p>The beautiful thing about this is that: you can dominate.</p>
<p>Most websites are terrible. Google any service in any suburb right now.</p>
<p>Half look old and clunky, and the rest are filled with corporate nonsense that don't sell the deal.</p>
<p><strong>You</strong> can dominate just by:</p>
<ol>
<li>Being clear about what you do</li>
<li>Making it easy to contact you</li>
<li>Answering what people search for</li>
</ol>
<p>No magic formulas, nor any $10,000 investment. It's just common sense that isn't that common.</p>
<h2>Moving Forward</h2>
<p>I build websites that do one thing: Get you more customers.</p>
<p>No corporate speak or unnecessary animations, nor any walls of text that you wouldn't even read.</p>
<p>Just clean, clear websites that convert visitors into clients.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, the prettiest website means nothing if it doesn't convert.</p>
<hr>
<p><em>P.S. - My team and I work with (mostly local) businesses that want their website to convert more. If that's you, get in touch and let's see if we're a good match: <a href="https://timelessweb.com.au/contact">https://timelessweb.com.au/contact</a></em></p>
