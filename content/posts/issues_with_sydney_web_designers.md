Hey.

A few weeks ago I was reading a book: '$1,000,000 Web Designer'. Just checking out the competition.

To cut a long story short, it showed me that 90%+ of web designers focus on one thing: _web design_.

Now I've been studying web design for months. Reading everything. Analyzing hundreds of websites.

Before reading that book, I didn't even think that web design in itself was the issue.

But I was wrong.

## The $10,000 Digital Business Card Problem

Here's what's happening in Sydney, and other major cities around the world: every web design agency is selling the same thing.

Pretty websites that don't do much.

They feed you words like "elevated digital presence" and sell you on a $10,000 website that just sites there and looks pretty.

Meanwhile, their potential customers are on Google right now, looking to find someone who can solve their problem. Looking for someone who simply says: "Blocked drain? Fixed today. Call now."

## So I Started Digging Deeper

Plumbers. Dentists. Accountants. Lawyers.

Know What I found?

90% of them say the same thing. It's the top performers that are different.

-   "Sydney's trusted partner"
-   "Excellence in everything we do"
-   "Transforming your digital landscape"

Here's the kicker: Their customers don't care about that stuff! That's only for you, as the business owner.

## What Do Customers Want?

What actually makes a phone ring?

After analyzing hundreds of top performers across many niches, I can tell you what's working.

The guy that get's calls? His website says: 'Blocked drain? Fixed within 2 hours. $0 call out fee."
The dentist who's booked? "Emergency appointments available today. No referral neeeded"

Do you notice what's missing?

There's no philosophy! No mission statements, nothing the customer won't benefit from.

It's just clear answers to what people really search for.

## The Designer Disease

Here's what most Sydney web designers do:

1.  Show you pretty templates
2.  Talk about 'user experience journeys'
3.  Add moving & animated elements (that make it look cool)
4.  Fill it with basic stock photos
5.  Write copy that sounds impressive, but doesn't really mean much
6.  Charge you $10,000
7.  Never talk to you again

You end up with a website, yes, but what does it actually achieve for you?

## It Has One Simple Job

Your website should have one job: Make your phone ring.

It doesn't need to impress your clients, nor win awards. It's all about the customers it closes.

After months of studying this, here's what separates top competitors from the crowd:

1. Headlines that highlight the immediate benefit: "Need an emergency electrician in Parramatta? Call now."
2. Proof that sells: "Average response time of 30 minutes"
3. One clear action: "Call now - [number]"

It's really that simple, yet it's so hard to find.

## The Opportunity

The beautiful thing about this is that: you can dominate.

Most websites are terrible. Google any service in any suburb right now.

Half look old and clunky, and the rest are filled with corporate nonsense that don't sell the deal.

**You** can dominate just by:

1. Being clear about what you do
2. Making it easy to contact you
3. Answering what people search for

No magic formulas, nor any $10,000 investment. It's just common sense that isn't that common.

## Moving Forward

I build websites that do one thing: Get you more customers.

No corporate speak or unnecessary animations, nor any walls of text that you wouldn't even read.

Just clean, clear websites that convert visitors into clients.

At the end of the day, the prettiest website means nothing if it doesn't convert.
